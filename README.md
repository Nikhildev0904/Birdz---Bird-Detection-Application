# Mobile Application for Classification of Indian Bird Species
üåø A Flutter-based mobile application for classifying Indian bird species in their natural habitats, leveraging cutting-edge machine learning models.

# Features
üê¶ Bird Classification: Identifies bird species using a ResNet-based classification model with 93% accuracy.
üéØ Bird Detection: Detects birds in images using YOLOv11 for precise localization.
üì± User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive UI with a carousel slider, search functionality, and detailed bird profiles.
üìÇ Contribute to Dataset: Allows users to upload bird images to expand the dataset and improve the classification model.

Technology Stack
Frontend
Flutter: For creating a cross-platform mobile application with a sleek and responsive design.
Backend
Node.js: For managing API communication and storing data efficiently.
Machine Learning
ResNet: For accurate bird species classification.
YOLOv11: For bird detection and localization in images.
TensorFlow Lite: For optimizing models for mobile devices.
Dataset
Size: 5,000+ images of Indian bird species.
Preprocessing: Applied augmentation, resizing, and normalization to improve model robustness.
How It Works
Upload an image of a bird.
The app detects if a bird is present using YOLOv11.
If detected, ResNet classifies the bird species.
View detailed information, including habitat, behavior, and images of the bird.
