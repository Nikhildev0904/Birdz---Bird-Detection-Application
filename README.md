# 🐦 Mobile Application for Classification of Indian Bird Species  
🌿 **A Flutter-based mobile application for classifying Indian bird species in their natural habitats, leveraging cutting-edge machine learning models.**

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🐦 **Bird Classification**: Identifies bird species using a ResNet-based classification model with 93% accuracy.  
- 🎯 **Bird Detection**: Detects birds in images using YOLOv11 for precise localization.  
- 📱 **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI with a carousel slider, search functionality, and detailed bird profiles.  
- 📂 **Contribute to Dataset**: Allows users to upload bird images to expand the dataset and improve the classification model.

## 🧭 How It Works  
1. **Upload an image of a bird.**  
2. The app detects if a bird is present using **YOLOv11**.  
3. If detected, **EfficientNetB7** classifies the bird species.  
4. View detailed information, including habitat, behavior, and images of the bird.
